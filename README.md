There is a lot of stuff that happens behind the scenes in Unity, so not everything is in here, but would be too complicated to include because of how Unity works.

All the important scripts are in the Assets/Scripts folder and subfolders and each are commented to show our contributions. There is also code in the *DANG NAME THIS* folder that is from the physical robot itself and is not for the Unity project, but was added for simplicity.
